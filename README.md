## About the project

**tododo** is a to-do list web application. It allows users to add and remove items from the list with a few clicks.

The project is developed in **React**. It uses [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/), and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) services.

**Authentication**: To enter, users can create an account with email and password or sign in with their Google account.

**Firestore**: The connection with the database in real-time allows each user to work with their own data and have the information always available.

The [config.js](./src/firebase/config.js) file contains all the Firebase configurations. The [api.js](./src/firebase/api.js) file handles all connections to the server.
